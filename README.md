# X–Z Gantry Control System

## Overview
This repository documents the software and system-level work performed on an X–Z gantry system developed as part of a collaborative engineering project with an industry partner.

Due to confidentiality agreements, application-specific details and proprietary information are omitted.

## System Description
The gantry system is controlled using a PC-based interface (UGS) connected to Arduino-based controllers.
Motion along the X and Z axes is driven by stepper motors through dedicated motor drivers, while the end-effector is controlled via a separate controller.

## My Contributions
- Team Lead for the project
- Defined the macro-level gantry architecture, including overall structure,    axis layout, and system configuration
- Responsible for system wiring, power distribution, and I/O integration to    support reliable software control
- Responsible for embedded software development and system integration
- Implemented motion control logic, sensor interfacing, and debugging
- Coordinated with teammates and incorporated feedback from industry engineers

## Design Focus
- Real-time motion control
- Hardware–software integration
- System debugging and validation
- Modular control architecture
